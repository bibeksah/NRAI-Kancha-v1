# Auto-Detect TTS Implementation - COMPLETE ✅

## Summary
Successfully implemented automatic language detection for Text-to-Speech (TTS) functionality. The app now automatically detects whether the text is in English or Nepali and speaks it in the appropriate language without requiring manual language selection.

## Changes Made

### 1. Speech Service (`lib/speech-service.ts`)
- **Updated Method Signature**: Removed `language` parameter from `synthesizeSpeech()` method
- **Voice Change**: Switched from language-specific voices to multilingual voice:
  - **Old**: 
    - English: `en-US-AvaMultilingualNeural`
    - Nepali: `ne-NP-HemkalaNeural`
  - **New**: `en-US-YunYiMultilingualNeural` (auto-detects English and Nepali)

### 2. Chatbot Component (`components/chatbot.tsx`)
- **Updated TTS Call**: Removed language parameter when calling `synthesizeSpeech()`
- **Added Comment**: Clarified that Yunyi Multilingual voice handles auto-detection

## How It Works

### Auto-Detection Flow:
1. User receives AI response in English or Nepali
2. User clicks the speak button
3. Azure's Yunyi Multilingual Neural voice automatically detects the language of the text
4. Speech is synthesized in the correct language without manual selection

### What the Language Toggle Now Controls:
The language toggle in settings is **still present** and now controls:
- ✅ **Speech-to-Text (STT)**: Which language to recognize when user speaks
- ✅ **UI Text**: Interface language (buttons, labels, messages)
- ✅ **Example Prompts**: Which language's example questions to show
- ❌ **Text-to-Speech (TTS)**: No longer needed - auto-detects!

## Benefits

1. **Seamless Bilingual Experience**: Users can freely mix English and Nepali in conversations without changing settings
2. **Fewer Clicks**: No need to switch TTS language manually
3. **Smarter UX**: The app automatically adapts to the content language
4. **Maintained Functionality**: STT still respects language preference for better recognition accuracy

## Testing Recommendations

1. **Test English TTS**: Send message in English, click speak button
2. **Test Nepali TTS**: Send message in Nepali, click speak button
3. **Test Mixed Content**: Try AI responses with both languages
4. **Test STT**: Verify voice input still works with language selector
5. **Test Stop Button**: Ensure stop button still interrupts speech properly

## Technical Details

**Voice Used**: `en-US-YunYiMultilingualNeural`
- Supports: English (en-US), Nepali (ne-NP)
- Automatically detects language from text content
- No additional configuration needed

## Future Enhancements (Optional)

- Could remove language state variable if STT also implements auto-detection in the future
- Could add visual indicator showing which language was auto-detected
- Could implement fallback voices if Yunyi is unavailable
